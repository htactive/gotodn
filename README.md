This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Below you'll find information about performing common tasks. The most recent version of this guide is available [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).

## Available Scripts

If yarn was installed when the project was initialized, then dependencies will have been installed via yarn, and you should probably use it to run these commands as well. Unlike dependency installation, command running syntax is identical for yarn and npm at the time of this writing.

### `react-native link`

Link all your libraries.

### `npm start`

Build your app in development mode.

### `react-native run-ios`

Attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

### `react-native run-android`

Attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).

## Sharing and Deployment

Create React Native App does a lot of work to make app setup and development simple and straightforward, but it's very difficult to share demo to client. In this case, we should use [Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo).
